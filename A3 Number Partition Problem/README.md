# Programming Assignment 3 - Number Partition Problem
## Harvard University, CS 124
### Qiang Fei, Jordan Turley

We compared several heuristics to solve the number partition problem.

### Compile

    g++ partition.cpp -o partition
    
### Run

To run the program with input from a text file, containing exactly 100 integers each on a separate lines, and with a given algorithm using the codes given in the programming assignment, run the program as follows:

    ./partition 0 [algorithm code] [input file]

For example:

    ./partition 0 12 input.txt

To run the simulation for task 4, run the program as follows:

    ./partition 1 0 0
